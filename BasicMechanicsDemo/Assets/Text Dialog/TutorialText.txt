Narrator: So you're a first time player! You don't know how to move?? It's simple just use the arrow keys or wasd. Whichever suits you best! You can also cast spells using the left mouse button, and scroll through your spells using the mouse wheel. In addition you can open the map and inventory by clicking on the buttons in the right-bottom corner or by pressing 'm' or 'i'.
